BASS Audio Library Integration (x64)

This project now uses the BASS audio library (version 2.4) instead of PowerShell scripts for audio playback. This change was made for several important reasons:

Why BASS instead of PowerShell:

1. Performance and Efficiency:
   - Direct C/C++ API calls eliminate PowerShell process overhead
   - No script generation or interpretation required
   - Lower memory footprint and faster initialization
   - Reduced CPU usage during audio playback

2. Reliability:
   - Native integration with the SKSE plugin eliminates external dependencies
   - No script execution permission issues
   - No Windows PowerShell execution policy restrictions
   - Stable and predictable behavior

3. Licensing:
   - BASS is free for non-commercial use
   - Royalty-free distribution allowed
   - No licensing fees for personal projects
   - Open and permissive license terms

4. Technical Advantages:
   - Comprehensive audio format support (MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, etc.)
   - Real-time volume control and effects
   - Stream-based playback for large files
   - Hardware acceleration support
   - Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS, mobile)

5. Code Quality:
   - Cleaner and more maintainable code structure
   - Direct access to low-level audio functions
   - Better error handling and debugging capabilities
   - Professional-grade audio processing

This migration represents a significant improvement in audio playback reliability, performance, and code maintainability for the OSoundtracks-SA-Expansion-Sounds-NG project.
